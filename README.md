# Optimized_DeepRMSA
An Optimized DeepRMSA Code
This program is forked from X. Chen, but the performance of the agent design is not very good and the the original code can not support python 3.x API, the author made some modifications.
  1. Change the file write time.
  2. Re-design the DRL rewords system(Add the dynamic fragmentation detection).
  3. The original code do not support many Python 3.x API, so the author made proting job from Python 2.x to 3.x on this part.

The main modification in the DeepRMSA_Agent.py file.
After the training the new code has an obvious advantage than OG on the Blocking probablity.
